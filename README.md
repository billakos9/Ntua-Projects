The projects cover different topics in software development, engineering, and other technical fields, showcasing my learning process and problem-solving skills.

Contents:

- A variety of programming assignments, applications, and research projects

- Implementations of algorithms, data structures, and engineering solutions

- Code written in multiple languages, depending on the project requirements

Purpose:

- This repository serves as a portfolio of my academic work, demonstrating my progress and expertise in various technical domains. Feel free to explore the code and get insights into the methodologies and technologies used.

Notes:
